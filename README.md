# **Fish Eating Classification**

by Naufal Syawali "Wallskiy"
A Notebook for coding test entry to company eFishery, the purpose is to classifying fish is they got eating process or not, 

## Problem Definition 

In this challenge case, we got datasets about fish movements by index X, Y, Z, in that moment, that will lead the fish into eating session. Meanwhile, fish which got eat the feed will be label as 1, and the other which not have eat labelled as 0

## Literature Review

Mohd Razman in his paper entitled "Hunger classification of Lates calcarifer by means of an automated feeder and image processing" said about before or after feeding fish has many significant features, it has been reported that the area where the fish roams could provide cue on the state of hunger, as the hungrier fish is, the larger the area that it tends to cover either in a group or individually. Also in his paper, machine learning algorithm is demonstrated, it has show that K-NN has effectiveness in classifying fish hunger, and Principal Component Analysis employed to extracting features also reduce the computational time.
